# Flipkart-mobiles-sales-dashboard-using-Advanced-Excel
The Flipkart Mobile Sales Dashboard using Advanced Excel project involves designing and developing an interactive dashboard to track and analyze mobile sales data on Flipkart. The dashboard is built using advanced Excel features, including PivotTables, Power Query, and complex formulas, to automate data analysis and generate real-time insights. The dashboard integrates data from various sources, including sales, inventory, and customer information, providing a comprehensive view of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, revenue, and product performance. Dynamic visualizations such as charts and graphs are used to illustrate sales trends and highlight areas for potential growth. Additionally, Excel macros and VBA have been employed to automate repetitive reporting tasks, significantly improving efficiency. This project empowers business users to monitor performance against targets, optimize sales strategies, and make data-driven decisions to drive growth.
